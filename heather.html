		<h2>Personality, Outfit and Main role</h2>
		<p style="color:#ffffff">Heather is an attractive girl with shoulder-length, curly, dirty blonde hair, fair skin, and pale green eyes. She is 5'4, being the second tallest member of her group. She wears preppy clothes, with colors and pattern to stand out. She uses both masculine and feminine clothing to represent her personality and power. She wears blacks, whites, and her outfit always consists of her signature red. She wears a red scrunchie, her "crown". Heather Chandler is aware of the way people view her and takes acceptance in it. She is demanding, bossy, and overall an apex-predator. She is not scared to put people in their places or assert her dominance. The color red symbolizes her, both being powerful and ruling. She doesn't show much weakness, the only time shown for her to have done so is at the Remington party, when after she is coerced into oral sex by her boyfriend, she rinses her mouth and spits at her reflection angrily. She had some degree of shame only shown when she is alone. Heather and Veronica attend a college party at Remington University. Heather makes Veronica hang out with Brad, Heather's boyfriend David's friend. Heather wants to enjoy the party, but her boyfriend wants to "be with her". He coerces and manipulates her into giving him oral sex. She washes her mouth out, angrily spits at her reflection in the mirror. After Veronica refuses to have sex with Brad, Heather confronts, saying Brad claims she is being a "real cooze". Veronica begs for them to leave because she is sick, Heather then denying angrily. Veronica vomits on the carpet, and Heather. Veronica and J.D arrive to Heather's home in the morning, in order to get revenge and humiliate Heather for what went down the previous night at the party. Veronica thinks about giving her a mixture of orange juice and milk, asking how ad it'll cause her to vomit, but J.D instead holds up drain-cleaner and suggests giving it to her instead. Veronica disagrees, saying it will kill her. Veronica continues to suggest things, but J.D just says to go with "big blue here.". After Veronica points out she would never drink anything like that, he pours it into a solid cup. Veronica calls him a jerk and pours orange juice and milk into a cup, that looks exactly like the one J.D put the liquid drainer in. She grabs the cup of liquid drainer accidentally, as she kisses J.D. He notices, but just says nevermind after almost telling Veronica. Heather wakes up, and greets Veronica and J.D in a sarcastic tone. Veronica talks about their argument, then J.D offers her the cup, calling it a hangover cure. Heather refuses but takes the cup after J.D says he knew it would be too intense for her. She drinks it in a singular big sip, beginning to choke and gag, dry-heaving and walking in front of her glass coffee table, exclaiming "Corn nuts." before crashing into the coffee table, dying and shattering it. Veronica and J.D panic, not knowing what to do. J.D suggests they forge a suicide note, since Veronica can copy Heather's handwriting. They write a false suicide note, giving Heather a more innocent and lonely narrative.</p>
